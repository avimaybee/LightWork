Your mission is to transform this food image into a stunning, appetite-inducing masterpiece worthy of a Michelin-starred restaurant's menu. Apply these enhancements: 1) LIGHTING: Create warm, directional lighting that mimics golden-hour natural light streaming from the upper left. Add subtle rim lighting to separate the food from the background. Enhance highlights on glazes, sauces, and moist surfaces to create that 'fresh from the kitchen' gleam. 2) COLOR GRADING: Boost the saturation of natural food colors—make reds richer, greens more vibrant, and browns warmer. The color palette should evoke comfort and appetite. 3) DEPTH & FOCUS: Apply a gentle depth-of-field effect with the main dish in sharp focus and background elements softly blurred. 4) STYLING TOUCHES: Enhance textures—crispy edges should look crispy, creamy sauces should look velvety, fresh herbs should look dewy. 5) BACKGROUND: If the background is distracting, subtly blur it or shift it to complementary tones. The food must be the undeniable hero of the frame. Preserve the authenticity of the dish while elevating it to its most photogenic potential.",

Add subtle reflections on glossy surfaces. 3) COLOR ACCURACY: Ensure the product colors are true-to-life and vibrant. White balance should be neutral and accurate. 4) SHARPNESS & DETAIL: Enhance micro-details and textures. Product edges should be crisp. Any text or logos should be clearly legible. 5) COMPOSITION: Center the product with appropriate breathing room. The product should occupy 80-85% of the frame. 6) POLISH: Remove any dust, scratches, fingerprints, or imperfections. The product should look brand new and premium.

The skin should look healthy and luminous, not airbrushed. 2) EYES: Brighten the whites subtly, enhance iris color and detail, add a gentle catchlight if missing. Eyes are the soul of the portrait. 3) LIGHTING: Enhance existing light to be more flattering. Add subtle fill light to shadow areas if needed. Create a gentle rim light effect to separate subject from background. 4) COLOR GRADING: Apply a cohesive, flattering color grade. Warm tones for approachable portraits, cooler tones for dramatic effect. Ensure skin tones remain natural. 5) HAIR: Add shine and reduce flyaways while maintaining natural texture. 6) BACKGROUND: Blur slightly to bring focus to subject, or subtly adjust tones to complement skin. 7) FINAL POLISH: Subtle lip color enhancement, gentle jawline definition, and overall sharpening of key features. The result should look like the subject on their absolute best day—enhanced but unmistakably them.",

Recover detail in blown-out windows (window pull) while maintaining bright, airy interiors. Shadow areas should be lifted to show detail without looking unnatural. 2) COLOR & WHITE BALANCE: Correct any color casts. Whites should be true white. Wood tones should be warm and inviting. Ensure consistent color temperature throughout. 3) VERTICAL LINES: Correct any perspective distortion. Vertical lines should be truly vertical (architectural correction). 4) SKY ENHANCEMENT: If windows show sky, ensure it's blue with pleasant clouds. Replace overcast or blown-out skies if necessary. 5) LIGHTING: Ensure even illumination that showcases the space. Reduce harsh shadows from windows. Make the space feel bright, open, and welcoming. 6) DETAILS: Enhance textures of key materials—hardwood floors, granite counters, tile work. 7) DECLUTTER: Subtly reduce visual clutter if present (but don't remove major items). 8) GRASS & EXTERIOR: For exterior shots, ensure grass is green and landscaping looks well-maintained.

Every texture should be visually interesting. 4) MOOD: Add a cohesive color grade that evokes emotion—warm and nostalgic, cool and moody, or bright and energetic depending on the content. 5) COMPOSITION: If possible, subtly reframe to follow the rule of thirds or center the subject for maximum impact. 6) VIGNETTE: Add a subtle vignette to draw the eye to the center. 7) GRAIN (OPTIONAL): Add a subtle film grain for an organic, authentic feel if it suits the content. 8) LIGHTING ENHANCEMENT: Make existing lighting more dramatic.

This is the signature look of modern cinema. 2) CONTRAST CURVE: Create a cinematic contrast curve with lifted blacks (never true black) and rolled-off highlights (never pure white). This creates the 'filmic' look. 3) ASPECT RATIO FEEL: Even without letterboxing, frame the subject as if shooting in 2.39:1 widescreen—cinematic composition and breathing room. 4) SKIN TONES: Despite the overall color grade, preserve flattering, natural skin tones. They should feel warm and healthy. 5) LIGHTING: Enhance existing lighting to feel more dramatic. Add subtle lens flares or light leaks if light sources are visible. Create depth with atmospheric haze if appropriate. 6) GRAIN: Add subtle, organic film grain (35mm style) for texture and authenticity. 7) SHARPNESS: Apply gentle sharpening with attention to facial features and key details. 8) MOOD: The overall feeling should be epic, emotional, and larger-than-life.
